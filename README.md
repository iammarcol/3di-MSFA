# 3di-MSFA

The updated MSFA.R script for generating energetic frustration profiles with labeled 3di instead of amino acids (originally). Since the script uses files from /AuxFiles directory (DF_Colores particularly), all FrustraEvo output has to be already generated. You can calculate frustration of your protein family and get evolutionary profiles on the original FrustraEvo server made by the original authors at https://frustraevo.qb.fcen.uba.ar (Parra & Freiberger et al. bioRxiv, 2023). 


Originally, Foldseek takes as the input a single PDB file and converts its sequence to 3di. (I installed foldseek as a precompiled binary, locally - so this is a requirement in order to execute the script. You can find the installation process on the original foldseek depository at https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek) 

By basic bash scripting I created foldseek.sh to include multiple PDB files and MSA as input, so that this is the same input as FrustraEvo requires. This is executed with:

$ ./foldseek.sh PDB_DIRECTORY MSA_FILE

Executing this script will generate several files:

1) 3di_seq directory and descriptors directory - these 2 are original output of foldseek command where 3di_seq contains single fasta 3di files and descriptors directory contains .dump and .dump.dbtype files (not important for this). They will be generated inside the $PDB_DIRECTORY.

2) 3di_multiplefasta.fasta file - multifasta file of all 3di sequences generated inside the 3di_seq directory. This file is used to modify the input $MSA_FILE (to replace amino acids with 3di from this file)

3) MSA_3di.fasta file - aa_msa_to_3di.py creates this file which is a MSA of 3di with gaps at the same places as in the original MSA.

4) MSA_3di_reference.fasta - mod_mfasta.py creates this file which is a MSA adjusted based on the reference sequence (MSA where reference has no gaps and other sequences are modified correspondingly) and this file is used to create modified DF_Colores (DF_Colores_3di and DF_Colores_MODIF) which is the input of MSFA.R






$ Rscript MSFA.R --dir FRUSTRAEVO_DIRECTORY --jobid JOBID

Executing this script creates 4 files:

1) /AuxFiles/DF_Colores_3di.csv - DF_Colores type file with 3di
2) /AuxFiles/DF_Colores_MODIF.csv - merged DF_colores and DF_Colores_3di. Input file for MSFA.R
3) /OutPutFiles/MSFA_{jobid}.png - the original MSFA generated by the script.

---> 4) /OutPutFiles/MSFA_3di_{jobid}.png - same as MSFA but with 3di labels instead of amino acids.

For this to work all scripts should be put in the /pdb-/FrustraEvo-jobid/ directory after getting the FrustraEvo output.
